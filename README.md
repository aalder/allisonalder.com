My personal website

This is not up online yet. It will be up as soon as I figure out how to do this via Google Cloud Storage.

This is a little bootstrap, a little harp, a little jade, a little sass, all the good stuff.

Thanks Alice for teaching me sass and such when we were doing the HackBeanpot website. I figured I'd practice using the things so I may actually be competent at writing stuff for that in the future. 

Side note: the websiteImage.jpeg isn't used. It was a planned background, but it looks better without it.

Also ignore npm-debug.log. It's auto generated and a mess.
